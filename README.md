# The Algorithms

This repo is specially made for implementing various algorithms with code.
It will not cover the concept of the algorithms, but provide the personalized
implementation of the algorithm.

The implementation of the algorithms may not be properly optimized and well
written, but I will try to do as much optimization as possible. Feel free
to contribute for futher optimization and refactoring.

## Languages and technologies

I will be using `C++` as a major language for implementing the algorithams,
but I may use other languages or library for flexibality for some of the 
algorithms. The languages and technologies' details will be provided in their
dedicated `README` file in every sub-directories.
